Using Expo(a full-stack React Native framework with powerful cloud services to help you move faster at every stage of the app lifecycle.) to create a new project:
# Install Node.js and npm/yarn: 
Ensure you have Node.js and a package manager (npm or yarn) installed on your system.
Install Expo CLI (if not already installed):
Bash: npm install -g expo-cli
or
Bash:yarn global add expo-cli
# Create a new Expo project: 
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project in your terminal and run:
Bash: npx create-expo-app@latest YourProjectName (Ex: signMap)

Replace YourProjectName with the desired name for your project. 

Navigate into the project directory.
Bash: cd YourProjectName

Start the development server.

Bash: npm start
/
Bash: yarn start

This will open a new tab in your browser with the Expo Developer Tools, allowing you to run your app on a simulator/emulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.
